      <p>Part II of <a href="index.html">thinking about stuff that is currently Shadow DOM</a></p>
    </section>

      <h1>Enhancements</h1>
      <p>Ok, but the above doesn't address some of what seem like known "wants".  Beyond this, I think it gets tricky.  Personally, I'm not sure we know enough about them to say what is and isn't something that should be added to the platform, but I do know that having no potential answer - even a mediocre one that we can poke holes in and improve - is also not great, so what follows should be considered "separate" but interesting follow-up.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Hard and soft isolation</h2>
        <p>So far, some kind of "mount" just isolates the DOM from selectors totally.  That is, it's not a security boundary, you can easily cross it by following the links, but you can't use selectors to get from the outside to the inside even if you wanted to because selectors don't understand how to cross anything but parent/child links. Is that a problem?</p>

        <p>I've always thought "yes" this is a problem.  The commonly cited use-case is that the outside page wants to providing 'theming' advice for the stuff inside our special isolated world.  In other words, if I create a 'calendar' and it's got a nice blue theme and then you want to use it on your site which for some reason your designer convinced you should be orange - that just might cause you to think "yeah, but I'll need to customize it".  This example seems so basic and so patently obvious - of <em>course</em> you should be able to theme it with your own colors.  But I wonder how much of this is that we're so caught up in our frustration with native elements not being stylable in even basic ways that we immediately jump to what seems like an obvious solution: "yes of course you want to be able to cross the boundary and make it blue - at <em>least</em> it would do something safe <em>by default</em> and that's a pretty big deal.  At a minimum, anyway, this is where I've always been on the subject - until recently, and now I'm not so sure.</p>

        <p>Let me explain why: In a nutshell, it's because leads to inevitable follow up questions that I can't answer well.  It solves 1 problem but opens a whole series of new potential ones in the process.  Don't get me wrong: It <em>clearly</em> is better than what we have now - there's no doubt about that, and that makes it tempting to say "good enough".  <em>But</em> our current world doesn't have so many custom elements or isolation and thus degree of complexity we are able to deal with is somewhat limited by this fact.  Adding some kind of isolation and custom elements means we'll do it more and more and build increasingly complex things - we're changing the problem space.</p>

        <p>Now imagine that you create something like, say, an <code>x-panel</code> element with a titlebar which contains various buttons.  Of <em>course</em> you should be able to make the titlebar blue, so it's really tempting to say, no problem, if you consciously cross the boundary you can say something like <code>x-panel/mount/.titlebar { background-color: blue; }</code>.  But this case is so trivial that it's easy to look past the issues with that.  What happens when my panel hosts another element which uses .titlebar for something else and that thing -shouldn't- be blue?  I guess you'll want to refine your selector say 'only ones that are a child of the mount' likewise you'll want to set your own 'close' icon and you have a similar problem, so you'll want to say something like <code>x-panel/mount/>.titlebar>.closeIcon</code>.  As you start getting into real cases you see that you're getting pretty coupled with my implementation.  If I decide I need to add an element in between .titlebar and .closeIcon, I'm going to break your styles.</p>
        <p>Ah, but if you could create pseudo-elements this would be solved, right?  That's always been my answer as well, but again, I'm not so sure it would. Differentiating them requires some context and what about custom elements inside of other custom elements?  When you use it, are you actually grabbing a element?  Does that mean you have full powers to everything inside it?    Getting this right actually seems pretty confusing.  I'm not saying we _can't_ figure out the right way, I'm saying that I can't currently reason about it and I don't know</p>

        <p>It seems to me that when I stop and think about it - if you can actually touch this from the outside with CSS, inaddition to doing something innocent, you could do something disasterous -- you could actually break my 'panel-ness' for example.  Consider if we had only 1 base element and we had to build everything out of that.  If you were to build the select element you'd create the options dropdown full of block things and have it hide by default, this would have carefully constructed meaning to UAs by way of both CSS and ARIA.  These things together define it's select-ness... Without them, they cease to be a select.  By simply twiddling a CSS property incorrectly you could break an important aspect and make it no longer 'it'.  Background-color, of course, is not generally one of those things that could fundamentally break something - but lots in CSS is that way: The display property is kind of fundamental, for example.</p>


        <p>So, it's clear you have to be able to provide theming advice from the outside to the inside, but it's unclear how that should work or should be standardized. It's not actually clear to me that CSS, as it stands right now, is the right means to do this.  It gives you a nearly infinite number of levers that can be pulled, but what you really want, if you step back, seems to be something considerably more targeted.  What it seems you want are just "the appropriate levers".</p>

        <p>Given this, I'm going start with the <em>hard isolation</em> we've created and imagine, in my experiement that the way you communicate this information to custom elements *isn't* through CSSOM (and more directly through CSS) - but through something else at a low level and I'll handwave a higher-level for another day.  Then, the problem is considerably simpler - I just want to communicate exposed property values through a declarative OM.  Something simple like <code>{"x-panel.titlebar.color": "green"}</code>, then for my custom element to take that into consideraation when rendering.  It's not particularly complicated, it's not particularly dangerous and, I think, it's good enough.  It's easy to add levers but it's up to the element to define which ones are safe to add.</p>

        <p><em>Note that despite this - at least with this approach, you actually <em>could</em> still experiment with the CSS version of this because the enforcement it merely through specificity - it wouldn't be pretty (you'd have to out <code>:not</code> it), but you could do it - so I'm calling this "good enough".</p>
